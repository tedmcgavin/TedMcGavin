#HW_01 Ted McGavin's script. 
#
# First, I collected the R version number from R, 
# the RStudio version from RStudio, and the PostgreSQL  
# version from PostgreSQL.  
#
# I then went into RStudio, installed the DMwR package,
# loaded it, and issued the "help(sales)" command to find
# out how many observations it had.
#
# The script below puts out all the data I collected (I used
# a matrix format).  

# Below, the commands I issued in RStudio are are preceded
# the ">" sign and the R responses are preceded by the "#"
# comment sign.


# Here, I'm installing the DMwR package:
> install.packages("DMwR")

# Here are the responses:
# Installing package into ‘C:/Users/Lynn/Documents/R/win-library/3.1’
# (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)

# ‘TTR’, ‘gplots’, ‘xts’, ‘quantmod’, ‘zoo’, ‘abind’, ‘ROCR’
